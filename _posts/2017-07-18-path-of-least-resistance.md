When you have a lot to think about, problems unresolved, what do you tend to do?

Tonight, like so many nights of surrender, I take the path of least resistance. I'll tune out of this world and into another with Game of Thrones. 

Tomorrow with a rested mind, I'll do the hard work of contemplating.
