<p class="p1">A lot of problems are bubbling as I try to find a way to make money while deriving meaning out of the job. If I saw them as separate pursuits I would well have a clearer head.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In order to banish the dizzying and often headache-inducing uncertainty, I should just get a job like everyone else. That would neatly split the problem into two halves and make them easier to wrap my head around and tackle. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But to obtain clarity of career this way comes at a cost. If I start seeing meaningful work to be something outside of making money, I would have only half the time left to do meaningful work! In reality it would probably be even less than half. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So the pursuit carries on, down the same path. Along with millions of millennials and those after us, I continue my search for a meaningful career that pays enough to live a comfortable, un-extravagant life. </span></p>

<h1 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Coffee quality affects mind quality </b></span></h1>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On a lighter note, I realised today something important about coffee. I drink coffee once every day. It destabilises my biochemistry, but that is a cost I’m willing to pay because the hour after a cup is always the most creative and productive of the day. Besides, it’s the richest beverage that exists other than Canadian ice wine!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The revelation is this: the quality of beans correlates with the quality of my post-drink high. At N1 cafe in Hong Kong earlier today I had the best iced Americano (black coffee) I’ve had in months! When we walked out of that cafe I felt renewed. My mind was alive and sharp. The difference between today’s caffeine high and that ushered from the 3-in-1 coffee I’ve been having at home is so palpable I swear I could have pinpointed exactly the part of my brain that was experiencing a neural thunderstorm. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In other words, $5 coffees made from arabica beans roasted and served by hipster cafes can at times be a worthy investment. I’m going to re-start making espresso based coffee at home when I get home. I just have to figure out how to calibrate my grinder without wasting 20 percent of every bag of beans. If you have any tips please leave a comment. </span></p>
