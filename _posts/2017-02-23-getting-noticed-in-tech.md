What platform are you using to get noticed in tech?

For a noticeably growing group of people, it's YouTube. Some names are already starting to make rounds in the General Assembly programming classroom, like Traversy Media and fun fun function. These are programmers that "we all know" because they make videos about programming that many of us watch. 

The important idea here is what these videos do for their creators. Their videos make them visible to other people - programmers, newbies, entrepreneurs, and recruiters.
 
Regardless of the medium, be it video, writing, podcasting, as long as the "content" is easily accessible and provides entertainment, camaraderie, or education, it is worth your time creating. 

This is particularly true for newcomers to the tech scene (like me and, if you're reading this, probably you). Let your ephemeral thoughts, ideas, opinions, and skills transfer from the mind to the page/screen/speaker so that others can have the slightest opportunity to get acquainted with what goes on in that head (and heart) of yours. 

Maybe someone who chances upon and reads that article on your blog is in a ranked engineer in a well known startup looking to hire, or she knows someone who actually is and shares that _link_ with that person. You might get hired, or be awarded a job contract. 

The most important idea here is this: If some person is looking for someone just like you to collaborate with or hire, will they be able to tell when they land on your website?

If your answer is no, then it's time to get to work. Build your platform for getting understood.
