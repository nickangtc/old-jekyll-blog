Sometimes I feel like engineers engineer because they know that humans cannot be trusted to take charge of what's inside their mind and body. So they make things that people can then rely on to induce the adjustments that should've been taken care of by themselves, internally.

Can we, for example, be relied on to approach every issue we face with clarity of mind, such that we act fairly to people? No, of course not. Most of us can't even control the simmering anger we have at ourselves when the teabag drips while transferring it to the bin. So what do humans engineer? The electorate system and creative use of video cameras and social media.

I think engineers are ahead in their thinking than the rest of us.
