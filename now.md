This section is inspired by Derek Siver's [now movement](https://sivers.org/nowff), as a sort of "public declaration" of my priorities at the moment.

I graduated from a 12-week programming boot camp in November 2016 (I wrote a <a href="http://www.nickang.com/general-assembly-singapore-review/">review</a> if you're interested in that). Luckily for me, I learned that I like programming because I'm a lazy person and like building systems that ultimately let me laze more. Increasingly I'm also finding a greater fascination for the advanced technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning.

Right after the bootcamp, I stayed on for 3 months to help out as a teaching assistant. I <a href="http://www.nickang.com/7-things-i-learned-about-programming-bootcamps/">learned a lot</a> in the process of teaching people how to think like and be a programmer, and it was a lot of fun at the same time. One of the best short stints I've done so far!

Now (finally, on to the now), I'm a full-stack software engineer at Altitude Labs. Altitude Labs is a software development and design consultancy based in Hong Kong. I'm based in Singapore, and I work on a specific part of the company which is kind of like a startup within an established consultancy. We're building a SaaS product for e-commerce marketers to turn their dormant data into additional sales by enabling them to give instant product recommendations, personalised to every single customer, based on cutting edge data science.

I'm right in the center of this new job and have a lot of thoughts about business, people and customer management, and of course technology and programming. Browse the blog to peek into my (messy) brain activity. See you around!
