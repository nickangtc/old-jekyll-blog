Hey there, thanks for stopping by.
My name's Nick Ang. This is my little reserved spot on the vast interwebs where I ponder, meditate, shoot (a camera), write and post things that are interesting.

Many of us are similar in more ways than we realise or care to admit, so if there was a purpose of keeping this blog, it's for me to get to know you. No, really. I mean, if you've stumbled on this incredibly, incredibly obscure part of the internet and you're still hanging around, we must align in some respects.

So feel free to loiter and even litter (with comments). I'll see you around.
